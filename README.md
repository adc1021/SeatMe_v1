# SeatMe

## Introduction

Welcome to the official README for the OpenTable clone, SeatMe! SeatMe is a full stack web application built with Ruby on Rails and React.js. I decided to clone OpenTable out of my love for cooking and the bustling dining scene in NYC. User's have the ability to scan through a range of different restaurants.
Restaurants can be saved to users profile. Reservations can be scheduled, updated, and deleted. Reviews can also be left for each location.
